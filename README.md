Client setup:

In the terminal, run the command 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies.

Once the packages finish installing run the command, 'npm start'.

This should open your browser and direct you to 'localhost:3000'.

If running npm start does not open your browser and go to the site automatically, enter the url: 'localhost:3000'.

The client end should now be operational. 

Server:

Refer to the repository 'Practice-Log-server' for instructions on setting up the back-end of the app.

Using the app:

Input the amount of hours you have practiced in either skill A or skill B. Entering the number with decimals is okay. 

Each submit button will independently enter the hours for that activity. Inputting numbers into both fields and clicking submit will only record the hours for the activity linked with the submit button that was clicked.

Currently, there is not functionality within the app to change the name of the activity you are entering practice for, and to do so you must change the name manually in the source code.
